## Hi there 👋
I have created this organization to keep all the information around Kubernetes safe, like studies, hands-on, articles, tech talks.

## Errors and bugs

If something is not behaving intuitively, it is a bug and should be reported. Report it here by creating an issue: https://github.com/datamade/your-repo-here/issues

Help us fix the problem as quickly as possible by following [Mozilla's guidelines for reporting bugs.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/QA/Bug_writing_guidelines#General_Outline_of_a_Bug_Report)

## Pull requests

Your patches are welcome. Here's our suggested workflow:
 
- Fork the project.
- Make your feature addition or bug fix.
- Send us a pull request with a description of your work. Bonus points for topic branches!
